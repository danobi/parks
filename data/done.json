  },
  "Bosworth Street Open Space": {
    "Rating": 1,

  "Glen Canyon Park": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "One of my favorites in the city. On some trails it feels like you're in the middle of nowhere. Many good trails to take inside. Grab a banh mi from 'Viking subs' after - best spot in Glen Park IMO."

  "Mount Davidson Park": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Cross at the top is a bit weird. But otherwise has nice views out to Ocean beach. Feels a bit jungly on one side. Do not go within a few days of rain - gets really muddy. The fog will do that too."
