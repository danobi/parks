  "24th & York Mini Park": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Snakes in the ground. Chairs prison like. Art is nice, though."
  },
  "29th & Diamond Open Space": {
    "Rating": 1,
    "Remarks": "Yet another patch of grass that looks into some houses. Except this one was half torn down for construction."
  },
  "Alamo Square": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "Would be 5 stars except except too many tourists. Of course there are the painted ladies as well."
  },
  "Alta Plaza Park": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "Looks like a mound of grass from the approach, but once on top there's stunning views of the south side of the city. Playground at the top had lots of kids."
  },
  "Aquatic Park Historic District": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Seems a bit touristy but this place is just awesome. Love to swim here. Apparently there's yoga on Sundays as well."
  },
  "Baden-Joost Mini Park": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Earns its mini park name. Quite nice set of stairs. Lots of different flowers and smells. Not a straight stair down either - nice curves giving impression denser illusion. Definitely check out Sunnyside Conservatory near by."
  },
  "Billy Goat Hill": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Small but amazing spot overlooking the city. Sunset views are incredible. I also proposed here!"
  },
  "Bernal Heights Park": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Another classic spot in the city with great views and a paved trail up."
  },
  "Bernal Recreation Center": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Quite a sterile playground. Indoors area had a basketball court but it looked pretty old."
  },
  "Bosworth Street Open Space": {
    "Rating": 1,
    "Remarks": "Not sure how this qualifies as a park. I tried to eat a sandwich here before and there's not even anywhere to sit down."
  },
  "Dorothy W. Erskine Park": {
    "Rating": 3,
    "Remarks": "Nice panoramic views of the city. At top it's not much more than large dog park. But nice foliage."
  },
  "Duboce Park": {
    "Rating": 1,
    "Remarks": "Situated between a bunch of multi-family housing, this park feels neither natural nor intimate. With few benches, it's almost a prison panopticon. Nearby is a prison style blacktop - probably a school's. Surrounded by high wire fences. Not a very nice park."
  },
  "Douglass Playground": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "It's technically one park but it's split into two sections. On the upper side is the dog park. Quite nice - lots of trees circling a large field. On the lower side, some tennis courts and grass area. Felt a lot like golden gate park, except with some steep cliffs. Who know this could be in SF?!"
  },
  "Duncan-Castro Open Space": {
    "Rating": 3,
    "Remarks": "Rough patch of grass. But nice view of Sutro tower. It would have a nice city view but there's some unfortunately placed trees which block the most interesting bits."
  },
  "Embarcadero Plaza": {
    "Rating": 1,
    "Remarks": "The concrete fountain is cool, but this is otherwise not a park. Not much to enjoy except the fountain."
  },
  "Fairmount Open Space": {
    "Rating": 3,
    "Remarks": "Nice quiet spot in residential Glen Park. Has decent views of the city (although any of the houses on this street have better views from indoors)"
  },
  "Fort Mason": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "Lot going on here. Coffee at Equator is good. I find the path from here to Aquatic park a lot nicer."
  },
  "Garfield Square": {
    "Rating": 3,
    "Remarks": "Nice soccer field with teen game. Still smelled like weed. Large building in center with reasonable looking playground on other side. Felt like a relatively low effort park design."
  },
  "Glen Canyon Park": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "One of my favorites in the city. On some trails it feels like you're in the middle of nowhere. Many good trails to take inside. Grab a banh mi from 'Viking subs' after - best spot in Glen Park IMO."
  },
  "Golden Gate Park": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Have you really not visited yet?"
  },
  "Hippie Hill": {
    "Rating": 5,

  },
  "Holly Park": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "Loved how it was both round and elevated. Visited at night."
  },
  "Lafayette Park": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "Expansive, steep grade. Nice view of salesforce tower and sutro tower. View of ocean as well. Playground near top with tennis courts. Trees break up space well."
  },
  "Lake Merced Park": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Reasonably nice lake. Not very interesting in the winter. Would be a 3 star but the excessive street noise ruin my walks here."
  },
  "Lands End": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "I haven't come here enough. Will need to come back."
  },
  "Louis Sutter Playground": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Very nice playground, lots to do. Plenty of pickleball courts. The perfectly round duck lake was nice to look at."
  },
  "Marina Green": {
    "Rating": 3,
    "Remarks": "This place seems like it'd be awesome but it's just OK. I like biking down the straightaway here."
  },
  "Mount Davidson Park": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Cross at the top is a bit weird. But otherwise has nice views out to Ocean beach. Feels a bit jungly on one side. Do not go within a few days of rain - gets really muddy. The fog will do that too."
  },
  "Mission Dolores Park": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "Classic, but obviously not very peaceful."
  },
  "Moscone Recreation Center": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Interesting statues on Laguna street side but otherwise a very generic recreation center."
  },
  "Noe Valley Courts": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Just a normal park. Lots of dogs. Not much going on except for a tennis court and basketball court."
  },
  "Noe Valley Town Square": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Not much of a park. They have a nice farmers market here on Saturdays, though."
  },
  "Panhandle": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Awesome spot in the city. Great place to chill during a bike ride."
  },
  "Parkside Square": {
    "Rating": 3,
    "Remarks": "Difficult to reach from pine lake park. Nice view of hills and sutro tower. Large playground for kids; likewise for field. Pickleball and tennis courts on side. Good features but nothing to break up the park. Visually not so appealing, but good location and surroundings."
  },
  "Pine Lake Park": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Descends from street level into a lush canyon. Nice paved trail. Large serene lake. Walking further opens up into a large meadow with good foliage on sides. Just beautiful and so peaceful. Can't believe this is in the city."
  },
  "Potrero Del Sol Park": {
    "Rating": 3,
    "Remarks": "Next to freeway with lots of street noise. Nice skate park with large bowls. Good shade. Nice features. Proper playground for kids. Nice spots for families and adults as well."
  },
  "Potrero Hill Recreation Center": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "Came here often for walks during Covid. Has a bunch of stuff but nothing that really interested me."
  },
  "Precita Park": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Long strip of grass. There were lights hung on one side which were nice. Other side had construction."
  },
  "Prentiss Mini-Park": {
    "Rating": 1,
    "Remarks": "Unimpressive. Some sand and a bunch of fake cacti."
  },
  "Presidio of San Francisco": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Have you really not visited yet?"
  },
  "Rincon Park": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "Right by the water. Nice spot to relax after visiting farmer's market in Ferry building. Cupid's arrow is a little too large IMO."
  },
  "Rolph Playground": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Next to freeway on-ramp. Lots of street noise. Two baseball fields with a few tennis and basketball courts. Looks fairly new. Would be a lot nicer without the noise, but with it it's pretty bad. Not many trees to break up the park."
  },
  "Sigmund Stern Recreation Grove": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Well manicured grove. Different kinds of trees. Expansive feeling. At bottom getting yosemite vibes. Concert ground very nice with good use of stone. Wonderful gem in city - another one of those 'I can't believe this exists' places in SF."
  },
  "Starr King Open Space": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "I used to live on this street. Came here a lot during Covid. Excellent spot for a walk. Decent views of the city."
  },
  "Sue Bierman Park": {
    "Rating": 3,
    "Remarks": "Nice quiet park away from busy Ferry building and Embarcadero. Quite nice to bring a sandwich here."
  },
  "Sunnyside Conservatory": {
    "Rating": 5,
    "Remarks": "Just awesome. It's one of those places you could live your entire life in the city and not find. Lit stairs, many different kinds of vegetation. Lots of nice floral smells. Very dense. At the base there's some massive palm trees as well as a nicely preserved historical building. Was locked at night when I visited, but it looked like you could go in."
  },
  "Sunnyside Playground": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Regular old playground. Felt kind of sterile. Seemed to have an after-school center here."
  },
  "Sunset Playground": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Not much character. Standard tennis courts and a ball field with a playground. Seemed to have a large indoor field, but unfortunately closed when I visited."
  },
  "Sunset Reservoir Park": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "Park encircles the reservoir. On the northwestern end there is a wonderful elevated section that gives you simultaneous views of the ocean and the golden gate bridge. Plenty of benches as well. Really wonderful park. Can also do laps if in a walking mood."
  },
  "Topaz Open Space": {
    "Rating": 1,
    "Remarks": "This is not a park. It's a 40 degree incline patch of grass you cannot even walk up on."
  },
  "Walter Haas Playground": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Not much going on. Has a dog park which smells like piss."
  },
  "West Sunset Playground": {
    "Rating": 4,
    "Remarks": "What West Sunset Playground lacks in character it makes up for with volume. Massive fields for all kinds of sports. Plenty of open space and a library nearby to boot. It does seem like it belongs to the 3 nearby schools - and only happens to be open to the public."
  },
  "Yerba Buena Gardens": {
    "Rating": 2,
    "Remarks": "Would be a lot cooler if it was cleaner and had less loitering."
